TO GET STARTED
==============

Please do this before the workshop starts, 
like when I'm saying something boring or incomprehensible.

From the repository root directory:

    npm install

All dependencies and fancy developer tooling will now be installed. 
You will need to redo this every time someone adds a dependency. 

Now, start the local auto-refreshing auto-filewatching webserver with:

    ./js-watch.sh

or

    js-watch.cmd

Now open <http://localhost:54321> and there you go!

Troubleshooting:
* You might need to `sudo` that, not sure.
* If you're on Windows and it doesn't work, your Git directory might not be on the system PATH.
*
